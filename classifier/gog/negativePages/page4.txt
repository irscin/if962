platforms this is a solution for you Keeping track of all achievements earned by you and your friends hours played and games owned across platforms has never been this easy And the application is entirely free all you need is a GOG account to use itHow can I add my games to GOG GALAXY In GOG GALAXY  you’re adding games through official and community created integrations By connecting platforms the data about the games you own is automatically imported to the application On top of that you are also able to manually add single games even if they are not connected to any platformWill GOG GALAXY  show all my games or only those I have installed on my PCYes GOG GALAXY  will show all your games from connected PC and console platforms… even if they are not currently installedDo I still

customize my games libraryYes our goal is to provide you with the most options possible to customize your games library In GOG GALAXY  you’ll be able to create your own views based on different filters available in the app tags that you’ll create on your own and search queries you’ll come up with Mix and match all of those options to create countless library views Once you do save them for quick access and automatic synchronization On top of that you can also manually edit the metadata of every game in your master games collectionHow can I add my friends to GOG GALAXY Like with games in

opensource to ensure the transparency of imported dataWhat data does GOG GALAXY  share with other platforms We don’t share any data with third partiesHow can I delete my data from GOG GALAXY Once you have disconnected a platform from GOG GALAXY  we will remove all your imported data from our serversWhat are the community created integrations and how I can create oneWe want to offer integrations with all possible gaming platforms This is a challenging and timeconsuming process not only because these are technically complex projects but they also require negotiations and agreements with partners We want all our official integrations to be supported by respective platform holders so we make sure they’re inline with partners’ policies and that they’re safe While we’re hard at work on adding more official integrations we’ve decided to give you – the community – an opportunity to work on your own open source platform integrations The documentation about how to build your own GOG GALAXY  integrations for various gaming platforms can be found hereI’m a GOGCOM user what’s new for me in GOG GALAXY The whole client has been rebuilt from the ground up to be better and faster All
