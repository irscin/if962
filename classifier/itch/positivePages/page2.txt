edit Devil Inside Us Roots Of Evil What is it Here is my take on it if you wanted to see some game play Enjoy ] Reply PotatoChipGaming hours agoMan this is a great game Cant wait for the full release  things I noticed the frame rate drops dramatically when being attacked  performing the exorcism The med kit in the kitchen if you keep clicking in the cupboard it will keep giving you med kits Heres

by playing games that contain storylines like this but this demo changed my mind Iâm looking forward to the full release Great work Reply LeMuffinGamer day agothis is the best horror game demo i have ever seen trust me im very very honest with my reviews if you watch all my past videos I played so many horror games so far and trust me this full game has SO MUCH potential to be the best horror game of the year trust me im just so amazed by your sound designer too like holy crap Most of the itch io horror games right now are basically getting to be the same but this this right here is just amazing I WILL BE ADDING TO my steam wishlist asap and will be waiting Reply Gleisther days agoVery nice game  Keep up the good workReply MardEMomin days agoBeing a senile priest was quite fun cant wait until this game releaseReply Mango days agoCheers man this is an awesome demo Looking forward to the full thingReply Dev days agoNot bad for a demo honestly can see this going a long way Keep it

GAME IVE EVER PLAYED Ive never screamed this loud great job on the game guys cant wait till the full version definitely will be playing Reply Cyberwolf days agoThis game was pretty dang fun this coming from a guy whos not a huge fan of getting spooked Really enjoyed the demo The only issue I really had was how slow the faith bar refills pretty sure I would have died if the last dog in the dark place hadnt just ran off after biting me a couple times other than that its perfect as it is Made a video hope you enjoy Reply CrazyCheesePuf YT days agoTHIS GAME WAS SO LOUD On a serious note this game has serious potential and I cant wait for the whole game Keep up the good workReply BerryDeaf days agoInteresting demo I really liked the faith mechanic to dispel demons and objects Being able to visually see how much faith is nice I love the idea of exorcising a house and try to piece together a story through notesdemonic items You scared me a couple times I really like the monsters appearancesI do have a few critiques for the game I feel like stamina is not being utilized in the demo at all I hope you guys may have a reason for a stamina bar in the full game There are a few grammar errors but nothing too bad The cross is a bit too close to the face when activating "faith" I would stick it out a bit further so you can see what is happeningIt looks like you guys worked hard on this game The premise and direction are very exciting to see I am looking forward to the full release on steam Great job guysReply Andrew Malefice days agoFunny game good job Mr TittzReply jimkose days ago  edit Hey I really want to download this demo but it is downloading via utorrent as a rar file Why is it not a zip folder and what can I do to open this When it downloads as a rar I cannot open it with anythingReply zzzlaud days agoYou should still be able to extract it with zip or Winrar Right click and click extract Reply Paco Barba days agoVisually it is amazing I have only missed some immersion in the game For example the pause to show on the screen every time you pick up an object or things like that Otherwise a great game I have had a small bug when changing the quality in options losing control of the mouseReply MrSkull Game Studio hours agoThanks a lot for playing and also your feedback and video Thanks also for the report about the mouse bug we will find out whats happening Reply ThatRussianGamerGuy days agoLoved the demo Some unusual gameplay  intriguing story  creepy demons Cant wait for the full game Reply MrSkull Game Studio hours agoHey Russian

scary game here bud already wishlisted it on streamLooking forward to the full versionLots of scary moments with some great jump scares in here and the graphicsomg are so greatGreat game I really loved this oneReply KingPhantoms days agoFinally I can feel like a real life exorcist because of this game THE POWER I did find a small glitch where youre able to repeatedly grab more med kits from the top kitchen cabinet next to the fridge but after running the game back it appears that it doesnt happen every run Overall I LOVED the game and I cannot wait to see what the full game will look like I will most likely live stream it instead of making a video because thats how excited I am to play it entirelyReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoThanks so much for playingYour video was so fun to watch Thanks for the feedback great to see a "INFINITE LIFE" bug right off the start p we will definitely fix it haha See you in the full game D Reply MigsXL days agoI never thought Id have this much fun playing a priest but damn This game is great For a short demo it explains enough of the story for players to grasp what is happening and introduces the crucifix combat which is nothing short of satisfying I highly recommend this game and I cannot wait for the full release Well done devReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoNice video and nice reactionsWe love to see how people are playing it and also the reactions Thanks for playing and also for the feedback Were really happy to hear such a positive feedback Thanks a lot we are doing our bests DReply Nastronaut days agoThis game got me a few

playing and also for the feedbackReply TsukuruHouse days agoI need a gun rather than a crossReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoHahaha that would be nice  just take a carefull look at our screenshots shhhhh dont tell anyoneReply Z  days agothis game is going to be awesomeReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoOhhh so happy to hear that Thanks so much for playing and also for posting a videoReply Lady Random days ago  edit  I really enjoyed this demo and Im looking forward to the full version I like how the gameplay mechanics are determined by the fact that we play as an eldery priest with limited mobility who only has a crucifix to defend himself For me this ramps up the scare factor The voice acting is good and I like the dreamyblurry style not sure how else to phrase it of the cutscenes As for issues I think the biggest one is with the sound its way too loud A few other commenters mentioned that as well Theres a few misspellingstranslation errors that need to be fixed One commenter said the houselocations of the demo are kind of uninspired and Im inclined to agree However since there are more locations pictured on the game page that are not included in the demo Im hoping this wont be an issue Honestly I really really liked this demo and the scares it gave me Hopefully all issues are fixed in the full version because I will be adding this to my steam wishlist Nice job so far devReply Button Pushin Cushion days agoThis was genuinely terrifying and the atmosphere is really well done As a few other people have said there are some audio issues but I love the concept of this and youve done a great job with the demoReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoHey there Thanks for playing and posting the videoAlso thanks for the feedback DReply Flamez Plays days agoSome translation issues aside the game is a pretty decent demo Theres sound issues where everything is blaringly loud at you and holding the cross directly in front of you obscures so much of your vision but its creepy for sureReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoOhh nice to see you again you played our last game "TAXIDERMY" Thanks for playing "Devil Inside Us" as well we appreciate your video and also your feedback We will consider it to make a better experienceReply ezez game days agoððReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoThanks for playing and also for postingReply masterkeef days agoIts a pretty fun demo I like what youve done so far Ill definitely check out more of this when its ready The only thing I didnt like was the crazy loud sound effects but I adjusted them for my video Pretty cool thoughReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoLoved the video Jason haha yeah weve received a lot of feedback about the insanely loud audio Btw thanks for the video gameplay and also for your feedback Reply Neco The Sergal days agoMade a Lets play and gave as much constructive criticism and feedback as I could in hopes it makes the game betterReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoThanks for the construtive criticism we will definitely see what can be enhanced considering our resources and knowlage p Thanks also for the video and the honest feedback Reply Neco The Sergal days agoNot a problem hope it can be helpful and glad you can take it on the shoulder with strideReply Adrionic days agoWow This game legitimately terrified me a few times Absolutely phenomenal audio work in this game And I really love the concept as well as the use of the crucifix This felt like a very unique adrenaline filled experience Great work Reply MrSkull Game Studio days agoWhat a great video just laughed a lot Great haircut btw hahaThanks so much for your video and feedback That was awesomeReply MarcusFresh days ago  edit Thumbs up Good work at getting the player to want to dive in further I like the idea of the Priest using the crucifix as his weapon the rosary helping refill faith all thats good stuff I also like the idea of the protag being an older more feeble kind of guy which from the game synopsis and all the caffeine pills I came across I assume that will be more of a factor in the main game While the demo was quite brief I was intrigued and went ahead and added the game to my wishlist on Steam Ill be followingReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoThank you for playing and also for the video and feedback its very good to see how you guys are playing and also what are you thinking about it D Thanks a lot Reply Stella Abbasi days ago  edit Hello I played this game and I really enjoyed it the visuals looked great and the sound effects were neat as well one thing I was a little confused about is that in the kitchen cabinet the medkits were in infinite amount dont know if it was intentional but over all it was cool great work  Reply MrSkull Game Studio days agoHey thanks for playing our demo By the way thanks for the bug report damn i didnt see that s this is really important to be fixed thanks a lotReply Rami days agoReally enjoyed it Fun concept I like the idea of having to be careful with the characters old age haha I also thought the mechanics were fun Some of the writing was a little off but still understandable Really excited to see the full gameReply MrSkull Game Studio days agoNice video thanks for all your feedback and fun video D Reply bratchpatch days agoI cant wait for the full version of this Reply MrSkull Game Studio days agoYour video was just FANTASTIC I really enjoyed your commentary and the playthroughThanks for playing and also the video and all your feedback Reply mg days agoThe graphics are very well done and the gameplay is interesting using a crucifix to defeat demons and powered by the power of Faith Really a very interesting concept used here Congratulations Reply MrSkull Game Studio days agoThanks for your feedback
