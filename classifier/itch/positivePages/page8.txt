since I dont have a Mac to work on unfortunately So only Windows and Linux builds for now  Maybe dualboot windowsReply Modern Horror Gaming day agoThis is like DUSKHROT but killin pilgrims I first heard about your game through kickstarting EM and was super stoked to see the demo was here This is a No Commentary A Rank Run of the Demo ThanksReply zzzlaud day ago  edit  This was refreshing to play Seriously the gameplay feels so good The moment you get your hands on a shotgun it changes the entire dynamic Im going for that SRank because this game is just that fun  Thanks for making games The SRank run is now on my channel as wellReply imaethan day agoGlad you enjoyed it so much  Ill check out your video later this evening Thanks for playingReply FRACTiLE Games days agoThis looks very promising I tried playing on Linux with Wine but got black screen with UI on top stats crosshair although the intro worked just fine Not blaming anyone just tested my luck Reply imaethan days ago  edit Oh damn The next demo will have a Linux build as wellMaybe try changing the type of antialiasing Reply FRACTiLE Games day agoI had antialiasing disabled Its good to hear a native Linux version is coming I will wait for thatReply JackTheBloodyHanded days ago  edit  OMG what a bloody good time I couldnât get enough The gameplay is fast and fantastic and itâs about time someone makes a horrorthemed game in this setting The bullettime mechanic is extremely fun and the level encourages more exploration than you might think If you take the time to look youâll be rewarded I canât wait to see how Coven shapes up Reply imaethan days agoHey I enjoyed the video The thing with doing more damage when you were jumping over the villagers was because you were hitting them in the head You can damage the headtorsolimbs individually and they do different damage Though Im going to remove this for the axe as most people dont seem to realise it works like that Reply plasticfangs days agoThis was absolutely amazing Really enjoyed it My only suggestions would be to add music and a "casual" difficulty option but reading the comments below it looks like youre on top of it already I wouldnt change anything else Great jobReply imaethan days agoThank you So happy you enjoyed it so much D Reply imaethan days agoAbsolutely love the thumbnail as well by the wayReply Tzuay days agoFPS game I like it when I download and play Reply Marxxiez days ago  edit This had a great feel to it animations were fast and i knew what i had to do all the way LOVED the transition from title screen to the game text filled story just "YOUR IN" Going further i would like to see a cinematic of how she came to be maybe more witch like powers etc Very well done Plus love the mechanics you had in here  Reply imaethan days agoHey glad you enjoyed it You missed a few weapons but it seems that quite a few people have done when playing maybe I should put them more out in the open Yeah with more time spent on it Im going to develop the lore some more and maybe add a part between her burning and resurrection to give more context I really enjoyed the video keep up the great work dudeReply Z  days agoGREAT RETRO GAME DEVReply imaethan days agoLooks like you had a rough time You can use the axe to chop up bodies to get some health Also you can break down any wooden doorsReply Deleted post days agoDeleted  days agoReply imaethan days agoGlad you had a blast Ive already got a couple people working on music for this unfortunately Reply TsukuruHouse days agoAwesome gameReply JordanCup days agoAwesome demo and game Cant wait to see its releaseReply Sultan Scarlet days agoPlayed through it a bit had an odd issue where the mouse sensitivity didnt properly change until level restart Other than that Im pretty positive about this Eating enemy corpses is a pretty useful and thematic feature I gotta say Im in love with the general concept of "person is resurrected and is absolutely pissed" that reminds me of Blood so muchReply James Dornan days agogood game Ive been following for a while cant wait to see where it goesReply Mev days agoHey I had lots of fun playing this all I can say is that there are lots of visual bugs in the graveyard area  When you get close to some of the graves the patches of dirt would disappear and the headstone too but then when I move away it reappears  same with some trees At certain angles trees would completely disappear then reappear Other then that it was a very good demo and Im exited to play more  Reply imaethan days agoAh I think I need to rebake the occlusion culling Thanks for letting me know and Im glad you had fun playing  Reply YT_GamingZoom days agoTHIS GAME WAS AMAZINGI loved the oldschool quake horror style and the health regen system The atmosphere was great and I liked the backstory you have right nowReply imaethan days agoI really enjoyed the video definitely the most entertaining playthrough Ive seen so far I left a comment on the video just before I can send you some more demos as I make more levelsReply YT_GamingZoom days agoi would love that man do you have a discord so we can stay in contactReply imaethan days agoimaenithReply QUEENFAITH days agogreat jobs  vibes for vapor game  BLOOD S EPIC HOPE LOOK YOUR GAME FOR PLASTATION    d GGReply atd days agoJust tried the game Very nice experience It needs a little balancing on melee but good Job I have a few questionsAbout that strange revolvingshotgunis it inspired by the Puckle gun Is the secondary fire only on the crossbow or it will be on other weapons at the game releaseReply imaethan days agoThanks Glad you enjoyed it Yeah it needs balancing in general tbh As for the shotgun it is indeed A mix of that some older s revolvers And yeah all guns will have altfire modes on releaseReply Kohaegan days agoIs this playable with a Series X controllerReply imaethan days agoNo controller support yet Still early in developmentReply chillyapples days agoThe game and setting is good though I think that the enemies can be a bit spongy at timesReply imaethan days agoAye it needs a bit of a balance tbhReply billiejean_hehee days agoSo authentic and gory I love it But there are some issues Movement is okay until you have to jump on small platforms then it becomes a little bit tricky I agree with fellow commenters   hits with an axe on head is strange maybe  hit on head or high chance to stun can fix it Noncustomizable controls is a pain in the ass Right viewmodel is bruh maybe somewhere between middle and right should doThis game has so much potential keep it upReply imaethan days agoGlad you enjoyed it Thanks for the feedback  You can hit alt orto toggle walking might make the small platforms easier to navigate  Yeah I need to rebalance the game a bit a higher chance to stun sounds like a good idea Its on my todo list thankfully I agree its a bit of a pain Is it hard to see the model or What resolutionaspect ratio are you usingReply billiejean_hehee days ago x Not hard just preferences Taking too much space compared to middleReply imaethan days agoAh I get you Ill tweak it a bitReply zarazlf days agoThis game looks nice and fun I will diffently give a try will the game be out on steam I will pay money for it if you want but pleaseReply imaethan days agoIt will be getting a steam release  you dont have to pay for it now of course its only optionalReply Koooool days ago  edits Looks likeDUSK and DUSK is good Ill try it Reply imaethan days agoA welcome comparison Hope you enjoy itReply evapilot days agoI liked playing this demo It was fun but like a previous commenter said the enemies are tough Hope more updates come soon Reply imaethan days agoGlad you enjoyed it  yeah Ill be adding a difficulty option for sureReply Joseph jay days agothe movement is a bit jarring and the enemies are little bit strong but other than that it is pretty good  if I had to nitpick i think you could improve the menu styleReply imaethan days agoHey  thanks for the feedback Yeah enemies hit hard a difficulty option is on my todo list currently As for the movement and menu style if you have any suggestions that would be great ðReply Joseph jay days agothe movement is just a bit fast so you could slow it down this is just my opinion but the menu is just a bit unpleasant but it kinda fits but the game is great and I cant wait to play it again in the futureReply mg days agoI enjoyed playing this demo Im a fan of this style of FPS which refers to games like Quake I cant wait to play the full version Congratulations Reply imaethan days agoGlad you enjoyed  ReplyitchioÂ·View all by imaethanÂ·ReportÂ·EmbedÂ·Updated   day agoGames âº Shooter âº Free
