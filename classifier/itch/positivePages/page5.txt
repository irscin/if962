Was definitely going for unsettling and subtle humor Appreciate the thoughts and videoReply tamturk days ago  edit  a nice business meeting Reply Geoff Alday days agoThanks Itâs fun watching people from different countries and backgrounds play this I appreciate the videoReply CEL SHADE days agoI think you did a really good job for this to be your first game I got spooked by the cardboard dude And the corporate world dark humor was PERFECT The atmosphere was SO unsettling I will say the low turning radius my character had made turning a little difficult and the small hitbox to activate the button when I had to escape the robot BUT I DID MAKE IT OUT so its not impossible and it felt rewarding Like really rewarding The story was weird and didnt make sense when it was over but I feel like thats the nuance of a lot of indie games being weird and nonsensical It doesnt need to make sense Just have fun Anyway good job Geoff I hope to see much more from youReply Geoff Alday days agoI appreciate the feedback Itâs all been really helpful in understanding what works and what doesnât Thanks for taking the time to play it and for letting me know what you thinkReply GoodKhaos days
