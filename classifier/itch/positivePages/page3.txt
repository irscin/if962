liked the dynamics between the arcade machine and reality I thought the monster itself is a perfect match for this type of game theme I hope in the full game release there will be more challenges for

was great The way you implemented the connection between the game and Janitor was fantastic and the entire demo is a creepy feeling from start to finishReply Adrionic days ago  edit  This was a truly great demo Lots of mystery that made me hungry for more The "monster" is a perfect fit for the theme of the game the fact that what you do in the arcade game has real effects on the environment around you I really enjoyed my time playing this and I highly recommend it Great work Reply Neco The Sergal days agoAs expected the demo was nice and packed with whats needed to teaseentice Just enough while
