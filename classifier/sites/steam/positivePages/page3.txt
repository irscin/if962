playing  get involved with this game as it develops  Note  This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further  If you are not excited to play this game in its current state  then you  should wait to see if the game progresses further in development  Learn more What the developers have to say  Why Early Access   ‚ÄúOriginally  we had set ourselves a timeframe of about a year for Dorfromantik  with the release falling on mid late  ¬†However  in our view Dorfromantik is already in a perfectly playable and stable state with all core features and lots of polishing already in place   Dorfromantik is a peaceful and wholesome game and many of you are telling us that even the prototype helped you unwind in these globally harsh times  This has convinced us to bring Dorfromantik to the community earlier than we had originally planned ¬†An Early Access release allows us to do this and improve the game with updates and the feedback from you  the players   The Early Access version offers enough content to enjoy for many hours and will bring you a beautiful  relaxing experience  Also it can be a great distraction while sitting through boring Zoom calls  ‚Äù   Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access   ‚ÄúWe don t want to drag out the development of Dorfromantik unnecessarily  but continue to work towards the mid late   target for the full release ‚Äù   How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version   ‚ÄúThe core mechanics of Dorfromantik are complete for us and we would now like to build on them with more complexity and variety ¬†Next to a creative mode  we envision more biomes  more unlockable tiles  some with special behaviour  more options to collect points and more supported languages  But we also want to communicate quite openly and transparently where we don t want to go with Dorfromantik  namely   X strategy  trading   resource management  combat and multiplayer ‚Äù   What is the current state of the Early Access version   ‚ÄúDorfromantik is currently in a perfectly playable and stable state  There is a playable tutorial to learn the game mechanics and a¬†classic game mode where you can improve your own highscore  There will be   playable biomes and   unlockable tiles on the Early Access release ‚Äù   Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access   ‚ÄúYes  we would like to thank everyone who is already supporting us during Early Access with a reduced price for that period ‚Äù   How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process   ‚ÄúWe are a small team of   Game Design students and have set ourselves a clear goal with Dorfromantik for the year   We are happy with the current core gameplay mechanics and don t want to make any more big changes to it  We will read through all the community feedback and address it if we think it fits well with our ideas for Dorfromantik  We can also imagine leaving specific feature requests to the community via voting to decide what will be in implemented for the final game  Please note that we will mainly use the Community Hub in Steam or our Discord Server for all of this and communicate in English or German ‚Äù     Read more Buy Dorfromantik   R     Add to Cart   Buy Dorfromantik   Soundtrack  Includes   items  Dorfromantik  Dorfromantik Soundtrack

feedback for this game on the discussion boards About This Game  Dorfromantik is a relaxing building strategy and puzzle game in which you place tiles to create ever growing  idyllic village landscapes  With Dorfromantik  you can immerse yourself in a quiet  peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life  At the same time  Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one  To beat the highscore  you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles In Dorfromantik you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles  One after the other  you draw the top tile of the stack  place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit  Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed  such as forests  villages or water bodies  and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest  For example  the windmill wants to border   grain fields  the locomotive wants to be connected to   tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least   trees  Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape ¬†The game ends when the tile stack is used up As you expand the landscape  you can advance into new  colorful biomes and discover pre placed game objects that give you long term tasks  Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles  new biomes and new quests What Dorfromantik offersBuilding endless and beautiful landscapesUnique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanicsRelaxing and calming gameplayIdyllic village
