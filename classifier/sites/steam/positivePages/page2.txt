touching  and the puzzle side keeps you engaged while your heartstrings are being tugged ”  – MonsterVine“ a mind bending and heartwrenching puzzle game ”  – Screen Rant About This Game Maquette is a first person recursive puzzle game that takes you into a world where every building  plant  and object are simultaneously tiny and staggeringly huge   Maquette makes it possible by twisting the world into itself recursively in an MC Escher esque fashion  Head to the center of the world and you ll feel like a giant  towering over buildings and walls  But venture further out  and start to feel small as things get larger and larger   to the point where cracks in the ground become chasms  In Maquette you will explore the scales of everyday problems in a modern day love story   Where sometimes the smallest of issues can become insurmountable obstacles   System Requirements Minimum OS  Windows     Bit Processor  Intel Core i    AMD Phenom II X   Memory    GB RAMGraphics  Nvidia GeForce GTX    GB
