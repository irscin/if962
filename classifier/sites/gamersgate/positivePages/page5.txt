 PLEASE NOTE The BETA Version will be only available in German   English Language and only for Windows  "Help  we re all going to d  Wha  Oh  excuse me  it seems my system is no longer up to date – [old memory status deleted] – so  much better… WELCOME to the Spacebase Startopia  I m VAL  your helpful and efficient Space Station AI  According to my records  this Station hasn’t been used at all in the last   years  How very strange  Furthermore  it would appear that you are the only rational life form in this Sector  Well then  CONGRATULATIONS  I hereby officially pronounce you Commander of this Space Station  Hopefully you will enjoy more success than your predecessor who  according to the logbook  er… ran into some wormlike Aliens… Oh  nothing to worry about  To keep the same thing from happening to you  there s a lot you re going to have to do  Amongst others  there’s the development of further Sectors  maintenance of the three vital Main Decks as well as the customer acquisition and entertainment of our extraterrestrial visitors  who provide us with sufficient Energy for our plans for global improvement  Oh  and before I forget – it s probably just a bug in my security protocols anyway – but my sensors are showing just loads of enemy creatures in all of the other Sectors… So  what are we waiting for  Let s get to work  Let us join forces to conquer space " Spacebase Startopia captivates with its original mixture of economic simulation and empire building strategy paired with classic RTS skirmishes and a good dose of humor  In addition to the challenging single player Campaign and the versatile battle mode  there are also competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes for up to four players  And as if maintaining the three Space Station Decks  entertaining the eight Alien races and defending against enemy invaders were not enough of a challenge  the dynamic narrator AI is not going to mince matters and commentates the events in a lovely but sharp tongued manner  FEATURES The  mission  fully dubbed single player Campaign will require all your skills as Commander of the Spacebase Startopia as you strive to create one of the most attractive trade and tourism destinations in the known universe   Each of the three Decks will require your leadership skills  with the Sub Deck containing all of the Rooms vital to survival  while the Fun Deck focuses on your visitors and the flora and fauna found on the Bio Deck provides sufficient Resources for survival as well as a home to the graceful Dryads  Prevail against your competitors  for you are not alone on the Space Station  Sabotage your opponents  economy or attack them with your Mech Units  conduct trade and beware of Space Pirates eager to board your Station  The dynamic narrator AI “VAL” reacts to your decisions and is always at your side in both word and deed – and the occasional extremely unqualified comment  In addition to the extensive single player Campaign  an individually configurable sandbox mode as well as both a competitive and a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players awaits you  Spacebase Startopia Copyright     Kalypso Media Group GmbH  Developed by
