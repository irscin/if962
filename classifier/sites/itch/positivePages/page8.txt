DUSK HROT but killin pilgrims  I first heard about your game through kickstarting E M  and was super stoked to see the demo was here  This is a No Commentary A Rank Run of the Demo  Thanks Reply zzzlaud  day ago   edit   This was refreshing to play  Seriously  the gameplay feels so good  The moment you get your hands on a shotgun it changes the entire dynamic  I m going for that S Rank because this game is just that fun   Thanks for making games  The S Rank run is now on my channel as well Reply imaethan  day agoGlad you enjoyed it so much   I ll check out your video later this evening  Thanks for playingReply FRACTiLE Games  days agoThis looks very promising  I tried playing on Linux with Wine but got black screen with UI on top  stats  cross hair  although the intro worked just fine  Not blaming anyone  just tested my luck  Reply imaethan  days ago   edit  Oh  damn  The next demo will have a Linux build as well Maybe try changing the type of anti aliasing  Reply FRACTiLE Games  day agoI had anti aliasing disabled  It s good to hear a native Linux version is coming  I will wait for that Reply JackTheBloodyHanded  days ago   edit    OMG  what a bloody good time  I couldnât get enough  The gameplay is fast and fantastic  and itâs about time someone makes a horror themed game in this setting  The bullet time mechanic is extremely fun  and the level encourages more exploration than you might think  If you take the time to look  youâll be rewarded  I canât wait to see how Coven shapes up  Reply imaethan  days ago Hey  I enjoyed the video  The thing with doing more damage when you were jumping over the villagers was because you were hitting them in the head  You can damage the head torso limbs individually and they do different damage  Though I m going to remove this for the axe as most people don t seem to realise it works like that  Reply plasticfangs  days ago This was absolutely amazing  Really enjoyed it  My only suggestions would be to add music and a "casual" difficulty option  but reading the comments below  it looks like you re on top of it already  I wouldn t change anything else  Great job Reply imaethan  days agoThank you  So happy you enjoyed it so much  D Reply imaethan  days ago Absolutely love the thumbnail as well by the way Reply Tzuay  days agoFPS game I like it when I download and play  Reply Marxxiez  days ago   edit  This had a great feel to it  animations were fast and i knew what i had to do all the way  LOVED the transition from title screen to the game  text filled story just "YOUR IN"  Going further i would like to see a cinematic of how she came to be  maybe more witch like powers etc  Very well done  Plus love the mechanics you had in here  Reply imaethan  days ago Hey glad you enjoyed it  You missed a few weapons but it seems that quite a few people have done when playing  maybe I should put them more out in the open  Yeah  with more time spent on it I m going to develop the lore some more and maybe add a part between her burning and resurrection to give more context  I really enjoyed the video  keep up the great work dudeReply Z    days agoGREAT RETRO GAME DEVReply imaethan  days ago Looks like you had a rough time  You can use the axe to chop up bodies to get some health  Also you can break down any wooden doors Reply Deleted post  days agoDeleted   days agoReply imaethan  days agoGlad you had a blast  I ve already got a couple people working on music for this unfortunately  Reply TsukuruHouse  days ago Awesome game Reply JordanCup  days ago Awesome demo and game  Can t wait to see it s release Reply Sultan Scarlet  days agoPlayed through it a bit  had an odd issue where the mouse sensitivity didn t properly change until level restart  Other than that I m pretty positive about this  Eating enemy corpses is a pretty useful and thematic feature  I gotta say  I m in love with the general concept of "person is resurrected and is absolutely pissed" that reminds me of Blood so much Reply James Dornan  days agogood game I ve been following for a while can t wait to see where it goesReply Mev  days agoHey  I had lots of fun playing this  all I can say is that there are lots of visual bugs in the graveyard area   When you get close to some of the graves the patches of dirt would disappear and the headstone too  but then when I move away it reappears   same with some trees  At certain angles trees would completely disappear then reappear  Other then that it was a very good demo and I m exited to play more   Reply imaethan  days agoAh I think I need to re bake the occlusion culling  Thanks for letting me know and I m glad you had fun playing   Reply YT_GamingZoom  days ago THIS GAME WAS AMAZING I loved the old school quake horror style and the health regen system  The atmosphere was great and I liked the backstory you have right now Reply imaethan  days ago I really enjoyed the video  definitely the most entertaining playthrough I ve seen so far  I left a comment on the video just before  I can send you some more demos as I make more levels Reply YT_GamingZoom  days agoi would love that man do you have a discord so we can stay in contact Reply imaethan  days agoimaenith Reply QUEENFAITH  days ago great jobs   vibes for vapor game  BLOOD  S EPIC  HOPE LOOK YOUR GAME FOR PLASTATION        d GGReply atd  days agoJust tried the game  Very nice experience  It needs a little balancing on melee but good Job  I have a few questions About that strange revolving shotgun is it inspired by the Puckle gun  Is the secondary fire only on the crossbow or it will be on other weapons at the game release Reply imaethan  days agoThanks  Glad you enjoyed it  Yeah  it needs balancing in general tbh  As for the shotgun it is indeed  A mix of that some older  s revolvers  And yeah  all guns will have alt fire modes on release Reply Kohaegan  days agoIs this playable with a Series X controller Reply imaethan  days agoNo controller support yet  Still early in development Reply chillyapples  days agoThe game and setting is good though I think that the enemies can be a bit spongy at timesReply imaethan  days ago Aye it needs a bit of a balance tbhReply billiejean_hehee  days agoSo authentic and gory  I love it  But there are some issues  Movement is okay  until you have to jump on small platforms  then it becomes a little bit tricky  I agree with fellow commenters     hits with an axe on head is strange  maybe   hit on head or high chance to stun can fix it  Non customizable controls is a pain in the ass  Right viewmodel is bruh  maybe somewhere between middle and right should doThis game has so much potential  keep it up Reply imaethan  days agoGlad you enjoyed it  Thanks for the feedback   You can hit alt or to toggle walking  might make the small platforms easier to navigate    Yeah I need to rebalance the game a bit  a higher chance to stun sounds like a good idea  It s on my to do list thankfully  I agree it s a bit of a pain  Is it hard to see the model or  What resolution aspect ratio are you using Reply billiejean_hehee  days ago   x  Not hard  just preferences  Taking too much space compared to middleReply imaethan  days agoAh I get you  I ll tweak it a bit Reply zarazlf  days agoThis game looks nice and fun  I will diffently give a try  will the game be out on steam  I will pay money for it if you want but pleaseReply imaethan  days agoIt will be getting a steam release   you don t have to pay for it now of course  it s only optionalReply Koooool  days ago   edits   Looks like DUSK and DUSK is good  I ll try it  Reply imaethan  days agoA welcome comparison  Hope you enjoy it Reply evapilot  days agoI liked playing this demo  It was fun  but like a previous commenter said  the enemies are tough  Hope more updates come soon  Reply imaethan  days agoGlad you enjoyed it   yeah I ll be adding a difficulty option for sureReply Joseph jay  days agothe movement is a bit jarring and the enemies are little bit strong but other than that it is pretty good   if I had to nitpick i think you could improve the menu style Reply imaethan  days agoHey   thanks for the feedback  Yeah enemies hit hard  a difficulty option is on my to do list currently  As for the movement and menu style  if you have any suggestions that would be great ðReply Joseph jay  days agothe movement is just a bit fast so you could slow it down  this is just my opinion but the menu is just a bit unpleasant but it kinda fits  but the game is great and I cant wait to play it again in the future Reply  mg  days ago I enjoyed playing this demo  I m a fan of this style of FPS  which refers to games like Quake  I can t wait to play the full version  Congratulations  Reply
