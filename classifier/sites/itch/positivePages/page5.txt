Portuguese Reply Geoff Alday  days ago Thanks  Glad you enjoyed it as it is quite different Reply medusadasedusa  days ago Interesting game  I didn t find it as "scary" as I was hoping  but it got me a couple times  I m wondering if it would help to add the robot enemies in the cave as well  Anyway I added it to my playlist here if you wanna check it out Reply Geoff Alday  days agoThank you  I

goofiness  Loved it Reply Geoff Alday  days ago Thanks  Was definitely going for unsettling and subtle humor  Appreciate the thoughts and video Reply tamturk  days ago   edit    a nice business meeting Reply Geoff Alday  days agoThanks  Itâs fun watching people from different countries and backgrounds play this  I appreciate the video Reply CEL SHADE  days ago I think you did a really good job for this to be your first game  I got spooked by the cardboard dude  And the corporate world dark humor was PERFECT  The atmosphere was SO unsettling  I will say the low turning radius my character had made turning a little difficult and the small hitbox to activate the button when I had to escape the robot  BUT I DID MAKE IT OUT  so it s not impossible  and it felt rewarding  Like really rewarding  The story was weird and didn t make sense when it was over  but I feel like that s the nuance of a lot of indie games  being weird and nonsensical  It doesn t need to make sense  Just have fun  Anyway  good job Geoff  I hope to see much more from you Reply Geoff Alday  days agoI appreciate the feedback  Itâs all been really helpful in understanding what works and what doesnât  Thanks for taking the time to play it and for letting me know what you think Reply GoodKhaos  days ago This one kept me on edge and guessing until the end  Fun short experience  Loved the posters Reply Geoff Alday  days agoThanks  Glad you loved the posters  I had a lot of fun making those  There is a lot of source material to work with there Reply GripCity Gaming  days ago  Such a fun  creepy  and unsettling experience  The ending took me by surprise for sure  That cardboard cutout man was gonna give me a heart attack  I really look forward to more of your titles Reply Geoff Alday  days agoThank you  Itâs funny how a cardboard cut out can be scary  Who knew  Thanks for providing feedback and for making the video Reply GripCity Gaming  days agoI know right  Of all the things that I thought couldn t be scary haha  You re welcome Reply Karantiin  days ago Hello sir  did a gameplay video on this the good and bad is in description Reply Geoff Alday  days agoThanks for the video and feedback  It is greatly appreciated  Very helpful Reply Lucifer_exe  days ago Was a really well made game  The cardboard dude spokoed me a lot and the little jokes about negative remarks at the beginning was done well  The whole atmosphere and everything was done well  and the little hidden things you put around was also really fun to find  Great little game to play Reply Geoff Alday  days agoThanks  I appreciate the thorough feedback  Hope all is well Reply RobBoberty  days ago Pretty nice little game  Solid atmosphere and flow through the game  And some humorous elements as well
