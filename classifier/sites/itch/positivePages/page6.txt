to learn more about the creature what s happened here  Game is well paced with a good action sequence to finish up the demo  Overall leaves you wanting more  I will be keeping an eye out for the full game  Thumbs up Reply Lazyfoxe  minutes agoThank you very much Im glad you liked it  I hope to see you around for the full release as well Reply Adrionic  hours ago This was really well made  I love

this game Reply zzzlaud  days ago Hey Lazyfoxe  I noticed you asked for some feedback so I went ahead and played through your game  I give pretty thorough feedback at the end of my video and it ended up almost as long as the game itself but I hope it helps you out in making the game you want to make  Thanks for making games  Reply Lazyfoxe  days ago I really appreciate this video  You bring up some very good points  which will certainly influence how I approach the rest of the game  I m thankful you like how the movement works and I agree that lots of horror games  especially indie games  are very restrictive in that respect  Some of the things you bring up were inevitably going to be changed but a lot of the ideas you mention were very interesting to me and I will definitely incorporate them into the final game  The "show don t tell" style of storytelling is hard to achieve as I m a very amateur game developer but I understand the complaint of too many notes  Going down the "action" route is something that interests me more than the standard "exploration" route  as you put it  Those enemies are essentially fodder and will not be the strongest that you encounter  Your idea of a water enemy is something I hadn t considered but seems like a must now  it s a really cool concept  I feel as though I could keep the game in the lab setting but still have more varied environments as I currently have a couple of ideas for some  The complete story right now is  whilst bare bones   something I quite like Thanks for all the feedback  it was really helpful Reply zzzlaud  days ago I m glad I ll be looking forward to the future updates and am excited to see what you come up with I figured you were quite new in game development but it honestly feels to me that you have a better understanding of what a game should be than a lot of other indie devs  beginners and professionals  Sometimes  in my opinion  it seems as though people lose sight of the fact that games are meant to be fun and instead focus much more on design  You ve got the most important part down  and I m excited to see how you tackle the rest Thanks again for making games Reply Stella Abbasi  days ago Hello  I played this game and I really liked it  it was a short and sweet experience  one thing I found a bit weird was that it was  I  to pick up notes but over all it was neat  good
