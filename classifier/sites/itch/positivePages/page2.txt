 hours ago   edit  Devil Inside Us  Roots Of Evil  What is it  Here is my take on it if you wanted to see some game play  Enjoy  ] Reply PotatoChipGaming  hours agoMan this is a great game  Can t wait for the full release    things  I noticed the frame rate drops dramatically when being attacked   performing the exorcism  The med kit in the kitchen  if you keep clicking in the cupboard it will keep giving you med kits  Here s my playthrough  Great project    Reply Gamers nation  day agoNice project   Reply JokiGAME  day agoLoved it  Here s my playthrough Reply JackTheBloodyHanded  day agoSo very good so far  Iâm not usually scared by playing games that contain storylines like this  but this demo changed my mind  Iâm looking forward to the full release  Great work  Reply LeMuffinGamer  day agothis is the best horror game demo i have ever seen  trust me i m very very honest with my reviews if you watch all my past videos  I played so many horror games so far and trust me  this full game has SO MUCH potential to be the best horror game of the year  trust me  i m just so amazed by your sound designer too like holy crap  Most of the itch io horror games right now are basically getting to be the same but this  this right here is just amazing  I WILL BE ADDING TO my steam wishlist asap and will be waiting  Reply Gleisther  days agoVery nice game   Keep up the good work Reply Mard E Momin  days agoBeing a senile priest was quite fun  can t wait until this game release Reply Mango  days agoCheers man  this is an awesome demo  Looking forward to the full thing Reply Dev  days agoNot bad for a demo  honestly can see this going a long way  Keep it up man  recorded a video itReply zzzlaud  days agoFor being a   year old priest  this guy is pretty spruce  Not only that  but he also exorcises anime  Weird game  pretty good Reply OMGDonni  days agoSCARIEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED  I ve never screamed this loud  great job on the game guys cant wait till the full version  definitely will be playing  Reply Cyberwolf  days agoThis game was pretty dang fun  this coming from a guy who s not a huge fan of getting spooked  Really enjoyed the demo  The only issue I really had was how slow the faith bar refills  pretty sure I would have died if the last dog in the dark place hadn t just ran off after biting me a couple times  other than that it s perfect as it is  Made a video  hope you enjoy  Reply CrazyCheesePuf YT  days agoTHIS GAME WAS SO LOUD  On a serious note this game has serious potential and I can t wait for the whole game  Keep up the good work Reply BerryDeaf  days agoInteresting demo  I really liked the faith mechanic to dispel demons and objects  Being able to visually see how much faith is nice  I love the idea of exorcising a house and try to piece together a story through notes demonic items  You scared me a couple times  I really like the monsters  appearances I do have a few critiques for the game  I feel like stamina is not being utilized in the demo at all  I hope you guys may have a reason for a stamina bar in the full game  There are a few grammar errors  but nothing too bad  The cross is a bit too close to the face when activating "faith" I would stick it out a bit further so you can see what is happening It looks like you guys worked hard on this game  The premise and direction are very exciting to see  I am looking forward to the full release on steam  Great job guys Reply Andrew Malefice  days agoFunny game  good job Mr TittzReply jimkose  days ago   edit   Hey  I really want to download this demo but it is downloading via utorrent as a  rar file  Why is it not a zip folder and what can I do to open this  When it downloads as a rar  I cannot open it with anything Reply zzzlaud  days ago You should still be able to extract it with  zip or Winrar  Right click and click extract  Reply Paco Barba  days ago Visually it is amazing  I have only missed some immersion in the game  For example  the pause to show on the screen every time you pick up an object or things like that  Otherwise  a great game  I have had a small bug when changing the quality in options losing control of the mouse Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  hours agoThanks a lot for playing  and also your feedback and video  Thanks also for the report about the mouse bug  we will find out what s happening  Reply ThatRussianGamerGuy  days ago

Outstanding jobs devs  Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  hours agoHey Wilson  Thanks a lot for playing and also for the video  nice play and reactions  D Reply Wackywarlock YT  days ago Very scary game here bud  already wishlisted it on stream Looking forward to the full version Lots of scary moments with some great jump scares in here and the graphics omg are so great Great game I really loved this one Reply KingPhantoms  days ago Finally I can feel like a real life exorcist because of this game  THE POWER  I did find a small glitch where you re able to repeatedly grab more med kits from the top kitchen cabinet next to the fridge but after running the game back  it appears that it doesn t happen every run  Overall I LOVED the game and I cannot wait to see what the full game will look like  I will most likely live stream it instead of making a video because that s how excited I am to play it entirely Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Thanks so much for playing Your video was so fun to watch  Thanks for the feedback  great to see a "INFINITE LIFE" bug right off the start  p we will definitely fix it haha  See you in the full game  D Reply MigsXL  days ago I never thought I d have this much fun playing a priest  but damn  This game is great  For a short demo  it explains enough of the story for players to grasp what is happening  and introduces the crucifix combat which is nothing short of satisfying  I highly recommend this game  and I cannot wait for the full release  Well done dev Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoNice video and nice reactions We love to see how people are playing it and also the reactions  Thanks for playing and also for the feedback  We re really happy to hear such a positive feedback  Thanks a lot  we are doing our bests  DReply Nastronaut  days ago This game got me a few times and creeped me out  the graphics were really good in this game  It was a very good demo and good Job Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Nice reaction Just love to see players reacting  Thanks for playing and also for the feedback Reply TsukuruHouse  days ago I need a gun rather than a crossReply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoHahaha that would be nice    just take a carefull look at our screenshots  shhhhh  don t tell anyoneReply Z    days ago this game is going to be awesomeReply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Ohhh so happy to hear that  Thanks so much for playing and also for posting a video Reply Lady Random  days ago   edit    I really enjoyed this demo and I m looking forward to the full version  I like how the gameplay mechanics are determined by the fact that we play as an eldery priest with limited mobility who only has a crucifix to defend himself  For me  this ramps up the scare factor  The voice acting is good and I like the dreamy blurry style  not sure how else to phrase it  of the cutscenes  As for issues  I think the biggest one is with the sound  it s way too loud  A few other commenters mentioned that as well  There s a few misspellings translation errors that need to be fixed  One commenter said the house locations of the demo are kind of uninspired and I m inclined to agree  However  since there are more locations pictured on the game page that are not included in the demo  I m hoping this won t be an issue  Honestly  I really  really liked this demo and the scares it gave me  Hopefully  all issues are fixed in the full version because I will be adding this to my steam wishlist  Nice job so far  dev Reply Button Pushin  Cushion  days ago This was genuinely terrifying and the atmosphere is really well done  As a few other people have said  there are some audio issues but I love the concept of this and you ve done a great job with the demo Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoHey there  Thanks for playing and posting the video Also thanks for the feedback   DReply Flamez Plays  days ago Some translation issues aside  the game is a pretty decent demo  There s sound issues where everything is blaringly loud at you  and holding the cross directly in front of you obscures so much of your vision  but it s creepy for sure Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Ohh nice to see you again  you played our last game "TAXIDERMY" Thanks for playing "Devil Inside Us" as well  we appreciate your video and also your feedback  We will consider it to make a better experience Reply ezez game  days ago ððReply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoThanks for playing and also for posting Reply masterkeef  days ago It s a pretty fun demo  I like what you ve done so far  I ll definitely check out more of this when it s ready  The only thing I didn t like was the crazy loud sound effects but I adjusted them for my video  Pretty cool though Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Loved the video Jason haha  yeah we ve received a lot of feedback about the insanely loud audio  Btw thanks for the video gameplay  and also for your feedback  Reply Neco The Sergal  days ago Made a Let s play and gave as much constructive criticism and feedback as I could in hopes it makes the game betterReply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Thanks for the construtive criticism  we will definitely see what can be enhanced considering our resources and knowlage  p  Thanks also for the video and the honest feedback  Reply Neco The Sergal  days agoNot a problem  hope it can be helpful  and glad you can take it on the shoulder with stride Reply Adrionic  days ago Wow  This game legitimately terrified me a few times  Absolutely phenomenal audio work in this game  And I really love the concept  as well as the use of the crucifix  This felt like a very unique  adrenaline filled experience  Great work  Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoWhat a great video  just laughed a lot  Great haircut btw hahaThanks so much for your video and feedback  That was awesome Reply MarcusFresh  days ago   edit   Thumbs up  Good work at getting the player to want to dive in further  I like the idea of the Priest using the crucifix as his weapon  the rosary helping refill faith  all that s good stuff  I also like the idea of the protag being an older  more feeble kind of guy  which from the game synopsis and all the caffeine pills I came across  I assume that will be more of a factor in the main game  While the demo was quite brief  I was intrigued  and went ahead and added the game to my wishlist on Steam  I ll be following Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoThank you for playing and also for the video and feedback  it s very good to see how you guys are playing and also what are you thinking about it  D Thanks a lot  Reply Stella Abbasi  days ago   edit   Hello  I played this game and I really enjoyed it  the visuals looked great  and the sound effects were neat as well  one thing I was a little confused about is that in the kitchen cabinet the medkits were in infinite amount  don t know if it was intentional but over all it was cool  great work   Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoHey  thanks for playing our demo  By the way thanks for the bug report  damn i didn t see that  s this is really important to be fixed  thanks a lot Reply Rami  days ago Really enjoyed it  Fun concept  I like the idea of having to be careful with the characters old age haha  I also thought the mechanics were fun  Some of the writing was a little off  but still understandable  Really excited to see the full game Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days ago Nice video  thanks for all your feedback and fun video   D Reply bratchpatch  days ago I cant wait for the full version of this  Reply Mr Skull Game Studio  days agoYour video was just FANTASTIC  I really enjoyed your commentary and the playthrough Thanks for playing  and also the video and all your feedback  Reply  mg  days ago The graphics are very well done and the gameplay is interesting  using a crucifix to defeat demons and powered by the power of Faith  Really a very interesting concept used here  Congratulations  Reply Mr Skull Game
