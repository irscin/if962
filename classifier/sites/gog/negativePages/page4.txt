one place GOG GALAXY   Open Beta is available for Windows and Mac  Please download the installer on your PC Privacy Policy terms applyFAQWhat is GOG GALAXY   and why should I use it GOG GALAXY   is an application  thanks to which you’ll be able to combine multiple libraries into one and connect with your friends across all gaming platforms  consoles included  If your games and gaming buddies are scattered between different launchers and platforms  this is a solution for you  Keeping track of all achievements earned by you and your friends  hours played  and games owned across platforms has never been this easy  And the application is entirely free  all you need is a GOG account to use it How can I add my games to GOG GALAXY  In GOG GALAXY   you’re adding games through official and community created integrations  By connecting platforms  the data about the games you own is automatically imported to the application  On top of that you are also able to manually add single games even if they are not connected to any platform Will GOG GALAXY   show all my games  or only those I have installed on my PC Yes  GOG GALAXY   will show all your games from connected PC and console platforms… even if they are not currently installed Do I still need to have other gaming clients installed on my PC Yes  if you want to get access to any features specific to that platform  e g  installing or auto updating games  cloud saves  etc Will I be able to customize my games library Yes  our goal is to provide you with the most options possible to customize your games library  In GOG GALAXY   you’ll be able to create your own views based on different filters available in the app  tags that you’ll create on your own  and search queries you’ll come up with  Mix and match all of those options to create countless library views  Once you do  save them for quick access and automatic synchronization  On top of that  you can also manually edit the metadata of every game in your master games collection How can I add my friends to GOG GALAXY  Like with games  in GOG GALAXY   adding friends begins with connecting platforms  By doing so  you can find other GOG GALAXY users who are your friends on the platforms or social networks you have connected  Additionally  you’ll be able to see non GOG GALAXY users from friends lists of connected platforms – with an option to check their online status and chat with them cross platform What kind of stats and activities will GOG GALAXY   show me You’ll see all your games from connected platforms together with your progress in each title – achievements you’ve earned and your game time  Also  for your GOG GALAXY friends  you’ll be able to see their online status and what games they are playing  with their achievements and time spent in each title Will GOG GALAXY   spy on my computer No  We’re not in the business of users’ data  GOG GALAXY   is only importing information from connected platforms – you always know what is imported through official integrations  Additionally we’ve made the community created integrations open source  to ensure the transparency of imported data What data does GOG GALAXY   share with other platforms  We don’t share any data with third parties How can I delete my data from GOG GALAXY  Once you have disconnected a platform from GOG GALAXY   we will remove all your imported data from our servers What are the community created integrations and how I can create one We want to offer integrations with all possible gaming platforms  This is a challenging and time consuming process  not only because these are technically complex projects  but they also require negotiations and agreements with partners  We want all our official integrations to be supported by respective platform holders  so we make sure they’re in line with partners’ policies and that they’re safe  While we’re hard at work on adding more official integrations  we’ve decided to give you – the community – an opportunity to work on your own open source platform integrations  The documentation about how to build your own GOG GALAXY   integrations for various gaming platforms can be found here I’m a GOG COM user  what’s new for me in GOG GALAXY  The whole client has been rebuilt from the ground up to be better and faster  All features for third party platforms work for GOG COM  With the new games library  you’ll be able to filter  sort and add tags to customize your views and save them for easy access  Thanks to the new friends section  you’ll have a chance to track your friends progress in every GOG COM game  as well as see what they are currently playing  On top of that  GOG GALAXY   will remain your optional client for GOG COM games – features like auto updates  cloud saves  cross play  rollbacks and more stay the same as the GOG GALAXY you’re currently using  Once we include all features available in the current version of GOG GALAXY client to the   version  we will update everyone to the GOG GALAXY   application How can I participate in the Open Beta The Open Beta is already available and everybody is welcome to participate in it  To get access to GOG GALAXY   download the
